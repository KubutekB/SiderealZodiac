# SiderealZodiac

A simple C# console app for calculating (with some error) the sidereal zodiac signs.
I tried to be quirky and calculate the exact boundaries of the constellations with respect to the ecliptic.
Also, as of yet no option for setting the exact time (it defaults to 00:00 - midnight).
First implementation covers the sun only, with moon and planets to hopefully be added later. 

Running the app:
Download, extract and run Calendar/bin/Debug/net8.0/Calendar.exe from console (.NET required)
